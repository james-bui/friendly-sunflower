title: 313 King's Oolong Ginseng Tea 2nd Grade
description: The 313 King's Oolong Ginseng Tea consists of 2nd grade, fine oolong
  harvested during the premium seasons, spring and winter, and from the best area
  to grow oolong, the mountains of central Taiwan. The leaves are then blended with
  a touch of ginseng to create an incredible aftertaste. Each tea leaf is handpicked
  to ensure harvests of young terminal buds. The steeped tea has a light green hue,
  sweet flora aroma with roasted undertones, moderate tartness as the initial flavor,
  and a sweet, pure aftertaste which lasts after the sip.
