title: Ceramic Herbal Pot (Black)
description: This ceramic pot is ideal for brewing herbs, tea, and even soups. This
  is safe to put on a stove top. Although this is a glazed pot, we recommend using
  low heat on the pot for the first time after purchase as using high heat immediately
  may cause the pot to crack. Many people like to cook porridge or heat water on low
  heat in order to prevent cracks. Please refrain from exposing this pot to extreme
  temperature differences.
