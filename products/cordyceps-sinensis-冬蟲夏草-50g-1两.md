title: Cordyceps Sinensis - 冬蟲夏草 (50g - 1两)
description: 'Cordyceps are a rare combination of fungus and caterpillar that''s been
  historically used by locals in China, Nepal, and India for a wide range of issues.
  These range from cough and cold to diabetes and cancer. Some locals have even used
  it to strengthen their cows for a higher yield of milk. However, due to its difficulty
  to harvest and resultant limited supply, it can be quite expensive. This makes it
  a luxurious product for either self-consumption or as a gift. '
